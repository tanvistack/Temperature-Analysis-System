- Calculate:
  - Average temperature  
  - Hottest day  
  - Coldest day  
- Find:
  - Days above 35 degree C  
  - Days below 20 degree C  
- Calculate standard deviation

## 🚀 Code Logic

1. Temperature values are stored in a NumPy array.  
2. Statistical functions like mean(), max(), min(), std() are used.  
3. Conditional filtering (Boolean Indexing) is used to find extreme days.

## 📊 Sample Output

- Average Temperature: 33.97  
- Hottest Temperature: 40  
- Coldest Temperature: 28  
- Days above 35 degree C: [36 37 38 39 40]  
- Standard Deviation: 2.97
